This document assumes you have basic knowledge of Windows and Windows Services. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTRODUCTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Barcode Router is an add-on module that easily allows an organization to extract the barcode values from 
scanned documents, output documents with the corresponding barcode values, and then
 using your own script (in Windows Powershell), route these documents based on the barcoded values. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
PREREQUISITES
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Windows 8, 8.1, 10 (requires .NET Framework 4.5.2)

Hardware:
Processor 1 GHz, RAM 512 MB
20 MB Disk Space


------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLATION STEPS:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Run the setup.exe to install both the Barcode Router Desktop and Barcode Router Windows service. 
You can run this as a desktop application or in the background as a Windows service. 
You can not run BOTH at the same time. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1. Configure Barcode Router
------------------------------------------------------------------------

From your start menu, start up "Casenamics Barcode Router Desktop". 
It will prompt for administrative rights as it will require access to modifying the Configuration file. 
Click the menu, File, and then Settings. Specify the working folder location for Barcode Router.  
It will automatically create the necessary folders once the Barcode Router is started. 
Scanned documents will be scanned into the "input" subfolder. Documents here will be picked up by
Barcode Router and processed. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2. Configure Script
------------------------------------------------------------------------

When documents are read in, BarCode Router will generate a metadata file, with a .DAXML extension for each document that has different barcode values. 
These metadata files are stored in the Input_Work folder. Once all documents are read and the metadata files are created, Barcode Router will then run a 
script, processfiles.ps1, to process these documents. The install package includes this sample script file in the application "Scripts" 
folder (i.e. c:\program files (x86)\casenamics\casenamics barcode router\scripts). 

You can copy this same script to the folder, Scripts, that was created under the working folder in step 1 above. For example, if you specified
the working folder as "c:\casenamics\scanning", then a folder,"c:\casenamics\scanning\scripts", will be created. 
These folders are created once you start up the Barcode Router service. 
Place the script, processfiles.ps1, into this folder. 

You can edit this script and customize it to your own business rules. If you require assistance in creating this script or need a custom script,
please contact Casenamics at support@casenamics.com for professional services.  

Refer to Powershell documentation if you are not familiar with writing scripts in Powershell. 
It assumes you are using 32-bit Powershell scripts. You can use Powershell or notepad to edit these scripts. 

NOTE: Make sure the folder location for the script is set correctly in processfiles.ps1.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 3. Start BarCode Router
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Open the Barcode Router Desktop, and click "Start". 

If you would like to use the Windows service, open up the Windows service, and start up the service, "Casenamics Barcode Router".
Set the service account to run under "local system account". This will give it proper access to allow it to poll a network folder.
Start up the service and you are ready to process the documents. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 4. If there are issues, refer to log files in folders: 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Log files are found in the following sources:

Control Panel - Event Log - Application Log
[scanning folder]\BarcodeRouter.Log
[scanning folder]\Output_Error\ProcessFiles.Log <- Log From Powershell script, processfiles.ps1, if any. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Troubleshooting
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: Some of my barcode 39 labels are not scanning properly?
A: Make sure the barcode is not overlapping with any lines. Barcode 39 is based on bars, so interference from other lines will impact the 
ability to read in the barcode value. 

Q: What do my scanner settings need to be at?
A: The DPI should be at 600. You may want to adjust accordingly as this impacts your file size. 

Q: My files get stuck in the [scanning folder]\Work folder.
A: The script, processfiles.ps1, is responsible for moving the file out after it is processed. Check the script to make sure there are no errors. 

Q: In the script, it is not opening a database connection 
A: Check to make sure the proper 32-bit drivers are installed. Document Agent is a 32-bit application and uses 32-bit drivers. 

Q: When starting the service, it starts and stops. 
A: Make sure service is running under "local system account" privileges. 

Q: When running the .PS1 (powershell script), you get the error, "running scripts is disabled on this machine."
A: You must set the execution policy to allow powershell scripts to run. 

	In powershell, to get the policies, enter the command:
	Get-ExecutionPolicy -List

	To set the ExecutionPolicy for the level and scope you want, enter the command:
	Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope LocalMachine Unrestricted

Q: I have a network folder, but my files are not being processed.
A: From Windows Event Viewer, goto "Application and Service Logs" and select "Casenamics Barcode Router". You can see if the correct folder is being polled.
   In addition, make sure the service is running under the correct administrative privileges.
   Normally, this is due to security and the account the service is running under does not have the rights to monitor the network folder.
